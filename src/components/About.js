      <p>
        This project is a flashcard web application. It is built with React,
        React-Router and Google's Firebase real-time database, Firestore. For
        styling I've chosen to use Bulma, a CSS framework. I am also working on
        incorporating Jest unit testing, Proptypes and whatever else I can think
        of to prove to you that I know what I'm doing and should be hired
        immediately!
      </p>
